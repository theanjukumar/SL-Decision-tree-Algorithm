# PROJECT TITLE: 

PREDICTION OF "IRIS.CSV".DATASET FOR DECISION TREE ALGORITHM USING SUPERVISED LEARNING MACHINE ALGORITHM
# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

A american based botanical garden a grow iris flower in their lab.But using "bio-technology" in a single tree different type of flowe is grow.As a data science engineer find out how much accuracy is there all category contain same species
# CONCLUSION :

According to my decision accuracy will be 1%
